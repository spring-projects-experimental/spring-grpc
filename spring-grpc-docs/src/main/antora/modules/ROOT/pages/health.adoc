= Health

:spring-boot-docs: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference

Spring gRPC autoconfigures the standard https://grpc.io/docs/guides/health-checking/[gRPC Health service] for performing health check calls against gRPC servers.
The health service is registered with the gRPC server and a `HealthStatusManager` bean is provided that can be used to update the health status of your services.

== Actuator Health
When Spring Boot Actuator is added to your project and the {spring-boot-docs}/actuator/endpoints.html#actuator.endpoints.health[Health endpoint] is available, the framework will automatically periodically update the health status of a configured list of Spring Boot {spring-boot-docs}/actuator/endpoints.html#actuator.endpoints.health.auto-configured-health-indicators[health indicators], including any ({spring-boot-docs}/actuator/endpoints.html#actuator.endpoints.health.writing-custom-health-indicators[custom indicators]).
By default, the aggregate status of the individual indicators is also used to update the overall server status (`""`).

The following example uses `application.yml` to include the health status of the `db` and `redis` autoconfigured health indicators.

spring:
  grpc:
    server:
      health:
        actuator:
          health-indicator-paths:
            - db
            - redis
----
NOTE: The items in the `health-indicator-paths` are the identifiers of the indicator which is typically the name of the indicator bean without the `HealthIndicator` suffix.

You can use the xref:appendix.adoc#common-application-properties["spring.grpc.server.health.*"] application properties to further configure the health feature.

== Client-side
Spring gRPC can also autoconfigure the https://grpc.io/docs/guides/health-checking/[client-side] health check feature to your gRPC clients.
To enable health checks on a named channel, simply set the `spring.grpc.client.channels.<channel-name>.health.enabled` application property to `true`.
To enable health checks for all channels, set the `spring.grpc.client.default-channel.enabled` application property to `true`.

By default, the health check will consult the overall status service (i.e. `""`).
To use a specific service, use the `health.service-name` application property on the desired channel.

NOTE: The `default-load-balancing-policy` must be set to `round_robin` to participate in the health checking. This is the default used by Spring gRPC but if you change the setting you will not get health checks

The following example enables health checks for all unknown channels (using the overall server status) and for the channel named `one` (using the service `service-one` health check).

        enabled: true

          health:
            enabled: true
            service-name: service-one
