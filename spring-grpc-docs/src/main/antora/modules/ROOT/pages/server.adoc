[[server]]
= GRPC Server

This section describes core concepts that Spring gRPC uses on the server side. We recommend reading it closely to understand the ideas behind how Spring gRPC is implemented.
You only need to provide one or more beans of type `BindableService` to create a gRPC server, provided the classpath contains an implementation of a `Server`. The `BindableService` is a gRPC service that can be bound to a server.
The `Server` is the gRPC server that listens for incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate service implementation.

== Create a gRPC Service

To create a gRPC server, you need to provide one or more beans of type `BindableService`.
There are some `BindableServices` available off the shelf that you could include in your application (an example is the reflection service from the `grpc-services` artifact which allows clients to browse the metadata of your services and download the Portobuf files). 
Very commonly, you will create your own `BindableService` by extending the generated service implementation from your Protobuf file.
The easiest way to activate it is to simply add a Spring `@Service` annotation to the implementation class and have it picked up by the `@ComponentScan` in your Spring Boot application.

== Netty Server

If you use the `spring-grpc-spring-boot-starter` dependency on its own, the `Server` is a Netty-based implementation.
You can configure common features of the server by using the `grpc.server` prefix in `application.properties` or `application.yml`.
For instance, to set the port to listen on, use `spring.grpc.server.port` (defaults to 9090).
For more specialized configuration, you can provide a `ServerBuilderCustomizer` bean to customize the `ServerBuilder` before it is used to create the server.

=== Shaded Netty

You can switch to a shaded Netty provided by the gRPC team by adding the `grpc-netty-shaded` dependency and excluding the `grpc-netty` dependency.

		module("io.grpc:grpc-netty") {
			replacedBy("io.grpc:grpc-netty-shaded", "Use Netty shaded instead of regular Netty")
		}
	}
}

== Servlet Server

Any servlet container can be used to run a gRPC server.
Spring gRPC includes autoconfiguration that configures the server to use the servlet container if it detects that it is in a web application, so all you have to do is include `spring-boot-starter-web` and the `grpc-servlet` dependnecy in your application.

[source,xml]
----

	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.grpc</groupId>

dependencies {
    implementation "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web"
    implementation "org.springframework.grpc:spring-grpc-spring-boot-starter"
    implementation "io.grpc:grpc-servlet-jakarta"
}
----

The `spring.grpc.server.*` properties will be ignored in favour of the regular `server.*` properties in this case (with the exception of `spring.grpc.server.max-inbound-message-size`).
The servlet that is created is mapped to process HTTP POST requests to the paths defined by the registered services, as `/<service-name>/*`.
Clients can connect to the server using that path, which is what any gRPC client library will do.

The gRPC server has fewer configuration options when running in a servlet container, as the servlet container is responsible for the network layer.
You can still add `ServerBuilderCustomizer` beans to customize the server as it is built, but some features common in the "native" builders are not available and may throw exceptions at runtime.

[[server-interceptor]]
== Server Interceptors

=== Global
To add a server interceptor to be applied to all services you can simply register a server interceptor bean and then annotate it with `@GlobalServerInterceptor`.
The interceptors are ordered according to their bean natural ordering (i.e. `@Order`).

[source,java]
----
@Bean
@Order(100)
@GlobalServerInterceptor
ServerInterceptor myGlobalLoggingInterceptor() {
    return new MyLoggingInterceptor();
}
----

=== Per-Service
To add a server interceptor to be applied to a single service you can simply register a server interceptor bean and then annotate your `BindableService` bean with `@GrpcService`, specifying the interceptor using either the `interceptors` or `interceptorNames` attribute.

The interceptors are ordered according to their position in the attribute list.
When using both `interceptors` and `interceptorNames`, the former entries precede the latter.

In the following example, the `myServerInterceptor` will be applied to the `myService` service.

[source,java]
----
@Bean
MyServerInterceptor myServerInterceptor() {
    return new MyServerInterceptor();
}

@GrpcService(interceptors = MyServerInterceptor.class)
BindableService myService() {
	...
}
----

[[server-interceptor-blending]]
[TIP]
====
When a service is configured with both global and per-service interceptors, the global interceptors are first applied in their sorted order followed by the per-service interceptors in their sorted order.

However, by setting the `blendWithGlobalInterceptors` attribute on the `@GrpcService` annotation to `"true"` you can change this behavior so that the interceptors are all combined and then sorted according to their bean natural ordering (i.e. `@Order`).

You can use this option if you want to add a per-service interceptor between global interceptors.

== Observability

Spring gRPC provides an autoconfigured interceptor that can be used to provide observability to your gRPC services.
All you need to do is add Spring Boot actuators to your project, and optionally a bridge to your observability platform of choice (just like https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/actuator/observability.html[any other Spring Boot application]).
The `grpc-tomcat` sample in the Spring gRPC repository shows how to do it, and you should see trace logging and metrics when you connect to the server.

== Exception Handling

Spring gRPC provides an autoconfigured exception handler that can be used to provide a consistent way to handle exceptions in your gRPC services.
All you need to do is add `@Beans` of type `GrpcExceptionHandler` to your application context, and they will be used to handle exceptions thrown by your services.
A `GrpcExceptionHandler` can be used to handle exceptions of a specific type, returning null for those it does not support, or to handle all exceptions.

== Testing

If you include `spring-grpc-test` in your project, your gRPC server in a `@SpringBootTest` can be started in-process (i.e. not listening on a network port) by enabling the in-process server
All clients that connect to any server via the autoconfigured `GrpcChannelFactory` will be able to connect to it.
You can switch the in-process server on by setting `spring.grpc.inprocess.enabled` to `true` or by adding the `@AutoConfigureInProcessTransport` annotation to your `@SpringBootTest` class.

== Security

=== Netty

The netty-based server supports TLS and mTLS out of the box.
To configure the server you can configure an SSL Bundle in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.
An example would be:

[source,properties]
----
spring.grpc.server.ssl.bundle=ssltest
spring.ssl.bundle.jks.ssltest.keystore.location=classpath:test.jks
spring.ssl.bundle.jks.ssltest.keystore.password=secret
spring.ssl.bundle.jks.ssltest.keystore.type=JKS
spring.ssl.bundle.jks.ssltest.key.password=password
----

Here we configure a bundle named "ssltest" that uses a JKS keystore, similar to what you do with TLS support for https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/how-to/webserver.html#howto.webserver.configure-ssl[Spring Boot in other areas].
It is then applied to the gRPC server using the `spring.grpc.server.ssl.bundle` property.
To use self-signed certificates, for testing purposes only, you also need to set `spring.grpc.server.ssl.secure=false`.

=== Declarative Security with Spring Security

If you want to enhance the security of your gRPC server, you can use Spring Security by employing similar mechanisms to those used for regular HTTP security.
If Spring Security is on the classpath, some autoconfiguration will be automatically added to your project.
By default, just https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/web/spring-security.html[like in a servlet application], you will get a `UserDetailsService` from Spring Boot and an `AuthenticationManager` that will authenticate requests using HTTP Basic authentication.
Basic authentication is enabled by default, as well as "preauthentication" via mTLS.
Preauthentication works by extracting a user details object from the client's TLS certificate, matching the principal name with the user in the `UserDetailsService` (just like in a normal web application).
You can then use `@Preauthorize` on your `BindableService` beans to enforce authorization rules with roles (more precisely authorities in Spring Security terminology).

You can change the defaults and add your own rules by configuring beans of type `UserDetailsService` and/or `AuthenticationServerInterceptor`.
In this way you can move the authorization rules to a central place, and you can also add your own authentication mechanisms.
The `AuthenticationServerInterceptor` can be created from a Spring Security configurer of type `GrpcSecurity`.
Its usage will be familiar to anyone who has used Spring Security before.
Here's an example:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
@GlobalServerInterceptor
AuthenticationProcessInterceptor jwtSecurityFilterChain(GrpcSecurity grpc) throws Exception {
	return grpc
			.authorizeRequests(requests -> requests
					.methods("Simple/StreamHello").hasAuthority("ROLE_ADMIN")
					.methods("Simple/SayHello").hasAuthority("ROLE_USER")
					.methods("grpc.*/*").permitAll()
					.allRequests().denyAll())
			.httpBasic(withDefaults())
			.preauth(withDefaults())
			.build();
}
----

Here we configure a filter that allows access to one method only to admin users, and another to users with the "USER" role;
access to all gRPC services (e.g. reflection and health indicators) is allowed to all; and all other requests are denied.
We also enable HTTP Basic authentication and preauthentication (mTLS) (`withDefaults()` is a static import from the `Customizer` in Spring Security).

=== OAuth2 Resource Server

Similar to the way Spring Boot works https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/web/spring-security.html#web.security.oauth2.server[with normal web applications], if you have the `spring-security-oauth2-resource-server` dependency on the classpath, Spring gRPC will be able to automatically configure an OAuth2 resource server.
There are 2 choices for the token types, just the same as in Spring Boot, and they are configured with the same application properties and optional custom beans.

For JWT you need to set up either the JWK Set or OIDC Issuer URI.
The JWK Set URI is set via `spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.jwk-set-uri` (it's an endpoint in the authorization server).
You also need to have the `spring-security-oauth2-jose` dependency on the classpath to handle the JWT decoding.

For opaque tokens, it works exactly the same as with a regular web application, with the same application properties. E.g.

[source,properties]
----
spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.opaquetoken.introspection-uri=https://example.com/check-token
spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.opaquetoken.client-id=my-client-id
spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.opaquetoken.client-secret=my-client-secret
----

=== Servlet

The servlet-based server supports any security configuration that the servlet container supports, including Spring Security.
This means that you can easily implement your favourite authentication and authorization mechanisms.
The server will reject unauthenticated requests with a 401 status code and unauthenticated requests with an invalid token with a 403 status code, as with a normal HTTP API.
It will also send an appropriate `WWW-Authenticate` header, e.g. with the value `Bearer` to indicate that it is expecting a token (for example).
The gRPC response will also contain a `Status` with the appropriate error code and message.
For authorization checking, e.g. role-based access control, your `BindableService` beans can be annotated with `@PreAuthorize`.

N.B. if you customize the gRPC server call executors, you will need to ensure that you wrap them in a `DelegatingSecurityContextExecutor` (from Spring Security).
Spring gRPC handles this for the default configuration.

Spring gRPC will automatically configure the gRPC server interceptors, and https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/web/spring-security.html[Spring Boot will provide defaults] for an `AuthenticationManager` and a `UserDetailsService`.
Spring Boot will also provide default configuration for an OAuth2 resource server, if you set the classpath up correctly (following the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/web/spring-security.html#web.security.oauth2.server[Spring Boot documentation]) which will be used to validate the token.
You may still want to provide your own `SecurityFilterChain`, but you can use the defaults just to get started.
Here's an example with HTTP Basic authentication:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
	return http.httpBasic(Customizer.withDefaults())
		.authorizeHttpRequests((requests) -> requests.anyRequest().authenticated())
		.build();
}
----

By default, CSRF protection is automatically disabled for gRPC requests because it is incompatible with the protocol.
You can switch off that behaviour and configure your own CSRF protection if you want to by explicitly setting `spring.grpc.server.security.csrf.enabled=true`.
A servlet application that exposes gRPC endpoints on a different port (with `spring.grpc.server.servlet.enabled=false`) will also not have CSRF protection disabled by default.

=== Securing Individual Methods

Individual gRPC methods can be secured by adding `@PreAuthorize` to the method definition.
Or you can use the knowledge that the HTTP endpoint is `<service>/<method>` to configure the security using the usual `HttpSecurity` configuration.
Example:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
	return http.authorizeHttpRequests((requests) -> requests
		.requestMatchers("/Simple/SayHello").hasRole("USER")
		.requestMatchers("/Simple/StreamHello").hasRole("ADMIN")
		.requestMatchers("/grpc.*/*").permitAll()
		.anyRequest().authenticated())
		.build();
}
----

Here we allow access to the `Simple/SayHello` method to users with the `USER` role, and to the `Simple/StreamHello` method to users with the `ADMIN` role, and allow access to all gRPC-provided services (like reflection and health indicators), while disallowing access to all other methods unless authenticated.
