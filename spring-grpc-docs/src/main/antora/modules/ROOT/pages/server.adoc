[[server]]
= GRPC Server

This section describes core concepts that Spring gRPC uses on the server side. We recommend reading it closely to understand the ideas behind how Spring gRPC is implemented.
You only need to provide one or more beans of type `BindableService` to create a gRPC server, provided the classpath contains an implementation of a `Server`. The `BindableService` is a gRPC service that can be bound to a server.
The `Server` is the gRPC server that listens for incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate service implementation.

== Create a gRPC Service

To create a gRPC server, you need to provide one or more beans of type `BindableService`.
There are some `BindableServices` available off the shelf that you could include in your application (an example is the reflection service from the `grpc-services` artifact which allows clients to browse the metadata of your services and download the Portobuf files). 
Very commonly, you will create your own `BindableService` by extending the generated service implementation from your Protobuf file.
The easiest way to activate it is to simply add a Spring `@Service` annotation to the implementation class and have it picked up by the `@ComponentScan` in your Spring Boot application.

== Netty Server

If you use the `spring-grpc-spring-boot-starter` dependency on its own, the `Server` is a Netty-based implementation.
You can configure common features of the server by using the `grpc.server` prefix in `application.properties` or `application.yml`.
For instance, to set the port to listen on, use `spring.grpc.server.port` (defaults to 9090).
For more specialized configuration, you can provide a `ServerBuilderCustomizer` bean to customize the `ServerBuilder` before it is used to create the server.

=== Shaded Netty

You can switch to a shaded Netty provided by the gRPC team by adding the `grpc-netty-shaded` dependency and excluding the `grpc-netty` dependency.

			replacedBy("io.grpc:grpc-netty-shaded", "Use Netty shaded instead of regular Netty")
		}
	}

== Servlet Server

Any servlet container can be used to run a gRPC server.
Spring gRPC includes autoconfiguration that configures the server to use the servlet container if it detects that it is in a web application, so all you have to do is include `spring-boot-starter-web` in your application.

----

The `spring.grpc.server.*` properties will be ignored in facour of the regular `server.*` properties in this case.
The servlet that is created is mapped to process HTTP POST requests to the paths defined by the registered services, as `/<service-name>/*`.
Clients can connect to the server using that path, which is what any gRPC client library will do.

== Server Interceptors

=== Global
To add a server interceptor to be applied to all services you can simply register a server interceptor bean and then annotate it with `@GlobalServerInterceptor`.
The interceptors are ordered according to their bean natural ordering (i.e. `@Order`).

[source,java]
----
@Bean
@Order(100)
@GlobalServerInterceptor
ServerInterceptor myGlobalLoggingInterceptor() {
    return new MyLoggingInterceptor();
}

=== Per-Service
This is a **WIP** and will be available soon.
