== What's New in 0.6.0 Since 0.5.0

This section covers the changes made from version 0.5.0 to version 0.6.0.

=== Renamed Client Autowired Annotations
The old `@GrpcClient` annotation has been renamed to `@ImportGrpcClients` to better reflect its purpose, and to be more consistent with changes in the Spring framework.
The customizer that is applied to generated gRPC clients is now a `GrpcClientFactoryCustomizer` - it's main use is to modify the channel that a client is created with beyond the limits of what can be configured with `spring.grpc.client.*` properties.

== What's New in 0.5.0 Since 0.4.0

This section covers the changes made from version 0.4.0 to version 0.5.0.

=== Automatic Configuration of gRPC Clients
The `@EnableGrpcClients` and nested `@GrpcClient` annotations can now be used to automatically configure gRPC clients.
Each `@GrpcClient` can be used to enumerate the stub types explicitly, or to scan a base package for stubs.

== What's New in 0.4.0 Since 0.3.0

This section covers the changes made from version 0.3.0 to version 0.4.0.

=== Fine-grained starter modules
The following fine-grained Spring Boot starter modules have been added:

- `spring-grpc-client-spring-boot-starter` provides Netty gRPC client
- `spring-grpc-server-spring-boot-starter` provides Netty gRPC server
- `spring-grpc-server-web-spring-boot-starter` provides Servlet gRPC server

The current coarse-grained starter `spring-grpc-spring-boot-starter` still provides Netty gRPC server and client.
