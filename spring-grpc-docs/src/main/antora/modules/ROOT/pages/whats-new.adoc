== What's New in 0.4.0 Since 0.3.0

This section covers the changes made from version 0.3.0 to version 0.4.0.

=== Fine-grained starter modules
The following fine-grained Spring Boot starter modules have been added:

- `spring-grpc-client-spring-boot-starter` provides Netty gRPC client
- `spring-grpc-server-spring-boot-starter` provides Netty gRPC server
- `spring-grpc-server-spring-boot-starter` provides Servlet gRPC server

The current coarse-grained starter `spring-grpc-spring-boot-starter` still provides Netty gRPC server and client.
