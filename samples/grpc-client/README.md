# Spring Boot gRPC Client Sample

This project is a sample of a gRPC Client app with no server. Build and run any way you like to run Spring Boot. E.g:

```
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
...

```

The server has to be running on port 9090. You can use the `grpc-server` sample for that.

You can also build and run the application as a native image using GraalVM, in the normal way for a Spring Boot application. E.g:

```
$ ./mvnw -Pnative native:compile
$ ./target/grpc-client-sample
